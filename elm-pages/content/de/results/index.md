This is where we track our impact. Since we're only just starting out, for now
we are lucky to stand on the shoulders of giants:

## Leaderboard

[Offsetbitcoin.org ](http://offsetbitcoin.org/) is an earlier initiative similar
to netpositive.money. Today, the website only forwards to a donation page for
[Cool Earth](https://www.coolearth.org/) where you can donate in bitcoin.

They started back in 2018, however we only found out about them a few months
ago. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to contact them and they don't appear
very active today. We're happy to pick up the mantle, although of course we'd be
even happier about more active similar initiatives. Because this is not about
us, but about Bitcoin's carbon footprint. 

So it is with great pleasure that we report that Offsetbitcoin has collected at
least 1.82015599 BTC and offset at least 49 kt of CO2 so far. As you can see on
the [calculator page](calculator), this might be a small first step in a giant
endeavour. Still, we celebrate this wonderful start and we hope we can build on
their success.

Please inform us (on twitter [@netposmon](https://twitter.com/netposmon) or via
email <info@netpositive.money>) if you learn about or are building other ways of
making Bitcoin a net positive money, so we can celebrate them here!
