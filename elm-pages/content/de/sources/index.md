## What People Get Wrong About Bitcoin's Climate Footprint

Nic Carter explains much of what I've written on in the [FAQ](faq) concisely in this video:

## Beyond the Energy Techlash: The Real Climate Impacts of Information Technology

A fact-based reexamination by ITIF of sensational claims about the climate impacts of broader IT, including a section on Bitcoin. ITIF also has a Clean Energy Innovation Policy Program that we are encouraging people to donate to because it appears both very efficient and fitting to Bitcoin's ethos.

## Bitcoin energy use - mined the gap

Also a good explanation and rational look at FUD about Bitcoin mining's impact by the International Energy Agency. Unfortunately, some unexamined shitcoining promotion at the end.

## Implausible projections overestimate near-term Bitcoin CO2 emissions

A brutal scientific takedown of an unspeakably bad article on Bitcoin mining that appeared earlier in the same prestigious journal and was reported everywhere in the media. I wonder why this factual repudiation didn't receive the same attention.

## Digiconomist

Alex de Vries&rsquo; very biased views on the topic. But it does include links to further studies (those that support his views, mostly his own), and his estimations are getting
closer to cbeci&rsquo;s and others&rsquo;

## Offsetbitcoin.org

What we do. Done. 2 years earlier. We only found this pretty late, and it
appears the initative has stalled a bit. We also couldn't reach them for
collaboration so far. A great example to live up to anyway:

## Introducing CBPI: A New Way To Measure Bitcoin Network Electrical Consumption

not actually very new, but interesting article contrasting several evaluation
methods Tl;Dr: They get closer all the time. We know better how much energy is
spent every day. (Co2 - not so much)

## The Carbon Footprint of Bitcoin
Christian Stoll, Lena Klaaßen, and Ulrich Gallersdörfer 
in Joule

one of the earliest scientific estimates of Bitcoin's Co2 footprint

## Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining
Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol in Environ. Sci. Technol.

appears to be the latest and currently best actual estimate of CO2 emissions;
pioneered the use of the Life Cycle Assessment method for Bitcoin; finds that,
at least regarding Co2, impacts beyond electricity (waste etc.) are negligible

## Bitcoin’s future carbon footprint

Preprint by the authors of (#the-carbon-footprint-of-bitcoin) plus Shize Qin and
Da Zhang. Extremely speculative tea leaf reading making too many assumptions.
Still very interesting as probably the first written account of many factors
going into this question.

## The Cost of Bitcoin Mining Has Never Really Increased
by Yo-Der Song and Tomaso Aste. Gives an interesting perspective: The cost of Bitcoin mining has remained astonishingly constant at about 1% of the value transferred.
