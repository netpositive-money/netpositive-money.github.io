We're happy that you have found your way to us. 

## What is this?

netpositive.money is an initiative by bitcoiners who want to contribute to
climate change solutions. Our goal is to make Bitcoin a net positive money. If
you want to read more about our approach, please visit our [about
page.](about)

## What can you do for me?

That depends on who you are. We have assumed you care about global warming (everybody should), but beyond that:
    
* If you are a member of the press or just an interested world citizen, we commend you for being interested in a more nuanced discussion of Bitcoin mining's impact on the climate. We hope you have questions. In that case, why not have a look at the most [frequently asked ones](faq)? You can always ask more! Or maybe you're just looking for some [sources](sources) beyond FUD and denial.
* If you self-describe as a bitcoiner, we commend you for not taking a see-no-evil position. Maybe you have [questions](faq), too. Maybe you already know that you'd like to contribute. Then why not go straight to our [recommendations](partners)? Or maybe you just want an estimate of the personal carbon footprint of your hodlings? We've made a [calculcator tool](calculator) for that!

If you need to reach us for anything else, our contact data can be found on the [about
page](about).

Thank you again for giving us some of your precious attention, and let's become
a net positive money!
